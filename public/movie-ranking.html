<h1>The Best Movie Series - At Least According to Amy</h1>
<h2>Some of my favourite movie series!</h2>
<hr />

<p>I can't pick just one of these movies as my favourite, so I have chosen to list the whole series.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter - The Complete Series</h3>
<p>
A fun series about 3 friends at magic school. As the series progresses, the special effects keep getting better and better.<br />
The cinematography is amazing as well! I have watched these movies multiple times and still enjoy them every time!</p>

<h3>Marvel Movies</h3>
<p>There are so many movies that are part of this series. You can watch them in multiple ways as well. 
   You can watch them in the order of release, or you can watch them in chronological order, depending on your preference. 
   There are also lots of spinoff TV series that can be watched that complement the movies. <br />
   One of my favourite things to do while watching the movies, was looking for the creator of the characters, Stan Lee. 
   Until his death a few years ago, he made a cameo appearance in almost every movie that was made. It was fun to see what kind
   of a character he would play each time.

<h3>Movie Musicals</h3>
<p>I can do a webpage just on my favourite musicals! There haven't been too many musicals that I have seen that I haven't enjoyed.
   A few of my favourites would be "Sound of Music", "Music Man", "Rocky Horror Picture Show", "Chicago", "Grease", "Footloose",
   and "Dirty Dancing"<br />
   I have watched all of those movies multiple times and even though I can't sing, I love to sing along!
