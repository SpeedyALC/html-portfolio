<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Born and raised in Hamilton, Ontario. I have loved computers most of my life. I have always had an interest in programming,
  taking some programming courses in high school. Am I showing my age, by saying I learned C++? I look back now and wish I had pursued a 
  career in computers, instead of accounting... but hindsight is always too late! Fast forward a bunch of years and I tried
  a couple of college courses in web programming, but didn't get too far with it at that time.

<p>Now I am living in Nova Scotia (been here for 2 1/2 years) and at a great job. Our webpage needs to be updated, so I decided to learn
  more about web development so that I could create a new webpage instead of using Word Press. After some research and course comparisons
  I decided to take Web Development Bootcamp offered through Udemy to further my skills. Looking forward to
  learning all kinds of new skills! I previously only learned some HTML and CSS.

<p>I live in a small town and maybe this might be the start of a side hustle for me if I can make some awesome looking websites!</p>
